# Splist

### Overview
Splist is an Android application for shared shopping lists. Ideal for recurring expenses between the same people, such as roommates or family, Splist saves time by having one person buy all the items from a compiled list. Other members simply pay the buyer back -- and with modern digital payment options such as Venmo, the process has been made simpler.

### Design and Prototypes
Prior to development, I made some high fidelity designs using Adobe Experience Design.
